  <h1><?php echo $settings['website_name']; ?> Refund and Return Policy</h1>

  <p><?php echo $settings['website_name']; ?> provides custom web scripts and plugins that are **not refundable and not returnable**. This is because all of our scripts and plugins are custom-made and tailored to the specific needs of our customers. Once we have started working on a script or plugin, it cannot be returned or refunded.</p>

  <p>We understand that this may seem like a strict policy, but it is necessary to protect our business and ensure that we can continue to provide our customers with the highest quality products and services.</p>

  <h2>Exceptions</h2>

  <p>We may make exceptions to our refund and return policy in the following cases:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If you receive a script or plugin that is not as described or does not work as expected.</li>
    <li>If there is a technical issue with the script or plugin that we are unable to resolve.</li>
    <li>If you are not satisfied with the script or plugin for any reason and we are able to find another customer who is interested in purchasing it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you believe that you qualify for an exception to our refund and return policy, please contact us within 30 days of receiving your script or plugin. We will review your request and make a decision on a case-by-case basis.</p>
